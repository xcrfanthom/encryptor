# RSA Encryption and Decryption

The RSA encryption code generates public and private keys, encrypts user-provided text using the public key, and displays the encrypted message along with the keys.
On the other hand, the decryption code prompts the user to input a ciphertext (a list of integers) and the corresponding private key components (d and n) to decrypt the message.

Happy coding!
