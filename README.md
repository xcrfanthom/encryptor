# Encoder and decoder

This is a simple encoder and a decoder written in python to show an understanding of python as a demonstration. 
It will also be saved in this repository for combining it with other potential projects that I might have in the future. 
All of this code is free for personal use. Libraries that are not in the core of python were intentionally not used since it poses a greater challenge. 
Happy coding!
